# Listening



## Listening is a magical tweak that will toggle noise cancellation when media is playing and toggle transparency when media is paused. But it also will pause media when transparency is activated and play media when noise cancellation is activated.



### Listening is confirmed to work on iOS 14, but could be compatible with lower version. There are no options to configure and no screenshots to display.
