  Add your device IP in `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zprofile` or in project's `Makefile` for faster deployment
  ```base
  THEOS_DEVICE_IP = 192.168.1.12
  ```

  Add SSH key for target deploy device so you don't have to enter ssh root password every time
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -p 22 root@192.168.1.12 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
  ```

  Build the final package
  ```bash
  FINALPACKAGE=1 make package
  ```
