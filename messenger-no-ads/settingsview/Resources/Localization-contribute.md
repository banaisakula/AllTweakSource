I'm working on localization, if you like my tweak and want to help, you can help me translate to your language.

(Finished languages are here: https://github.com/haoict/messenger-no-ads/tree/master/pref/Resources)

Here are base strings

```
"APPLY" = "Apply";
"DO_YOU_REALLY_WANT_TO_KILL_MESSENGER" = "Do you really want to kill Messenger?";
"CONFIRM" = "Confirm";
"CANCEL" = "Cancel";
"MAIN_PREFERENCES" = "Main Preferences";
"NO_ADS" = "No Ads";
"DISABLE_READ_RECEIPT" = "Disable Read Receipt";
"DISABLE_TYPING_INDICATOR" = "Disable Typing Indicator";
"DISABLE_STORY_SEEN_RECEIPT" = "Disable Story Seen Receipt";
"CAN_SAVE_FRIENDS_STORY" = "Can Save Friend's Story";
"HIDE_SEARCH_BAR" = "Hide Search Bar (iOS 12 only)";
"HIDE_STORIES_ROW" = "Hide Stories Row";
"HIDE_PEOPLE_TAB" = "Hide People Tab";
"EXTEND_STORY_VIDEO_UPLOAD_LENGTH" = "Extend Story Video Upload Length";
"OTHER_PREFERENCES" = "Other Preferences";
"RESET_SETTINGS" = "Reset Settings";
"SUPPORT_ME" = "Support Me";
"DONATION" = "Donation 💰";
"BUY_ME_A_COFFEE" = "Buy me a coffee";
"FEATURE_REQUEST" = "Feature Request ✨";
"SEND_ME_AN_EMAIL_WITH_YOUR_REQUEST" = "Send Me An Email With Your Request";
"SOURCE_CODE" = "Source Code 🤖";
"FOUND_A_BUG" = "Found A Bug 🐛";
"LEAVE_A_BUG_REPORT_ON_GITHUB" = "Leave A Bug Report on Github";
```

After you finished translation, Please save and name it with your language code (if you don't know, just write down your country name)

E.g: English -> en, Japanese -> ja, Vietnamese -> vi...

And your nick name, I will add to Contributors part.

Finally, send me the result to my email "hao.ict56@gmail.com" or open issue on github.
