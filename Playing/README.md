## Playing
Playing is a tweak that allows you to get a notification when a new song starts.

### Features
- Doesn't spam your notifications list
   - Playing automatically removes the previous 'Now Playing' notification, this means that your notification list isn't being spammed with notifications but you're still getting the best experience.
- Change how your notifications behave
    - You can configure Playing's notifications like any other iOS App. Just go to **Settings > Notifications > Playing** and change what you need to!
- Customisable Notification Text
    - Don't like the default notification text? No worries. Just open the Playing preferences pane and customise your text!
- Applies settings without a respring
    - Pretty self-explanatory, isn't it? Respringing means less time listening to music, and no one wants that!
